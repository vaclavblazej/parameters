# Parameter hierarchy

This repository contains the data and scripts that generate the web with parameter hierarchy in the context of [parameterized complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_complexity).

* `data` holds raw data; hard to work with without the scripts
* `scripts` has source codes that export the data into a human-interactible form, they also generate the pages

What it the parameter hierarchy meant to provide:

* provide quick overview of parameters
* allow quick access to references (parameter definitions, bounds, counterexamples, etc.)
* (in future) help users with visualizing the boundary of tractability and hardness for their problems
* (in future) customize the view by hiding and positioning the nodes
* (in future) output TikZ code that can be directly used in a paper

It will take us a while to have majority of the parameter relations and references.
To give your suggestions and fixes (with references), please open a [github issue](https://github.com/vaclavblazej/parameters/issues) or [mail us](vaclav.blazej@warwick.ac.uk).

* Any copied material has a source link -- this is the preferred way. Everything else will be slowly replaced.
