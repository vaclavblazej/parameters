*Welcome, we collect parameters from the field of parameterized complexity analysis and create views and exports of them.*

This project is in its baby phase so we are grateful for any feedback.
You may write us a [mail](mailto:vaclav.blazej@warwick.ac.uk) or [raise a GitHub issue](https://github.com/vaclavblazej/parameters/issues).

Sources for this page are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vaclavblazej/parameters)

* Any copied material has a source link -- this is the preferred way. Everything else will be slowly replaced.
