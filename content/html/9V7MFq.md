## [treewidth](../IcKqSn) â†’ [clique-width](../U3jPaT)
* [Corneil2005](../HCGunF): \dots the clique-width of $G$ is at most $3 * 2k - 1$ and, more importantly, that there is an exponential lower bound on this relationship. In particular, for any $k$, there is a graph $G$ with treewidth equal to $k$, where the clique-width of $G$ is at least $2\lfloor k/2\rfloor-1$.
* This inclusion is proper because [cograph](#9Qd0Mx) graph class has bounded [clique-width](../U3jPaT) but unbounded [treewidth](../IcKqSn)
