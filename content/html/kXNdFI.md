## [distance to bipartite](../cLHJkW_dist) â†’ [chromatic number](../MB1Sr1)
* Removed vertices get one color each and we need only $2$ colors for the rest.
* This inclusion is proper because [planar](#loZ5LD) graph class has bounded [chromatic number](../MB1Sr1) but unbounded [distance to bipartite](../cLHJkW_dist)
