* page 1 : [tree-partition-width]({{< base >}}html/QP01gs) -- A graph $H$ is a partition of a graph $G$ if: each vertex of $H$ is a set of vertices of $G$ (called a bag), every evrtex of $G$ is in exactly one bag of $H$, and distinct bags $A$ and $B$ are adjacent in $H$ if and only if there is an edge of $G$ with one endpoint in $A$ and the other endpoint in $B$. The width of a partition is the maximum number of vertices in a bag. ... If a forest $T$ is a partition of a graph $G$, then $T$ is a tree-partition of $G$. The tree-partition-width of $G$ ... is the minimum width of a tree-partition of $G$.

* page 2 : [degree treewidth]({{< base >}}html/nCWUh3) upper bounds [tree-partition-width]({{< base >}}html/QP01gs) by a computable function and lower bounds it by a polynomial function -- $twp(G) \le 24tw(G)\Delta(G)$
