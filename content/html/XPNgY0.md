* [BuiXuan2011](../cNjhWx): **Definition 1.** A decomposition tree of a graph $G$ is a pair $(T,\delta)$ where $T$ is a tree having internal nodes of degree three and $\delta$ a bijection between the leaf set of $T$ and the vertex set of $G$. Removing an edge from $T$ results in two subtrees, and in a cut $\{A,\comp{A}\}$ of $G$ given by the two subsets of $V(G)$ in bijection $\delta$ with the leaves of the two subtrees. Let $f\colon w^V \to \mathbb{R}$ be a symmetric function that is also called a cut function: $f(A)=f(\comp{A})$ for all $A\subseteq V(G)$. The $f$-width of $(T,\delta)$ is the maximum value of $f(A)$ over all cuts $\{A,\comp{A}\}$ of $G$ given by the removal of an edge of $T$. ... **Definition 2.** Let $G$ be a graph and $A \subseteq V(G)$. Define the set of unions of neighborhoods of $A$ across the cut $\{A,\comp{A}\}$ as $U(A) = \{Y \subseteq \comp{A} \mid \exists X \subseteq A \land Y=N(X)\cap \comp{A}\}. The *bool-dim*$\colon 2^{V(G)} \to \mathbb{R}$ function of a graph $G$ is defined as $\mathrm{bool-dim}(A)=\log_2 |U(A)|$. Using Definition 1 with $f=\mathrm{bool-dim}$ we define the boolean-width of a decomposition tree, denoted by $boolw(T,\delta)$, and the boolean-width of a graph, denoted by $boolw(G)$.
