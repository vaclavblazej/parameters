* page 6 : [twin-width]({{< base >}}html/OrH7et) upper bounds [merge-width]({{< base >}}html/UWmTKl) by a computable function -- Theorem 1.4. Graph classes of bounded twin-width have bounded merge-width.
* page 7 : [bounded expansion]({{< base >}}html/lFz6Ci) upper bounds [merge-width]({{< base >}}html/UWmTKl) by a computable function -- Theorem 1.6. Graph classes of bounded expansion have bounded merge-width.
* page 7 : [merge-width]({{< base >}}html/UWmTKl) upper bounds [flip-width]({{< base >}}html/jYG7BR) by a computable function -- Theorem 1.7. Every class of bounded merge-width has bounded flip-width.
* page 7 : [weakly sparse and merge width]({{< base >}}html/HJjpOL) upper bounds [bounded expansion]({{< base >}}html/lFz6Ci) by a computable function -- Corollary 1.8. A graph class has bounded expansion if and only if it has bounded merge-width, and is weakly sparse (exclydes some biclique $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph).
