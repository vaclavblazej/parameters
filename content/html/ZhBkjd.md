* [branch width]({{< base >}}html/lIcmuR) -- ... branch-decomposition of an undirected graph $G$ is a hierarchical clustering of the edges of $G$, represented by an unrooted binary tree $T$ with the edges of $G$ as its leaves. Removing any edge from $T$ partitions the edges of $G$ into two subgraphs, and the width of the decomposition is the maximum number of shared vertices of any pair of subgraphs formed in this way. The branchwidth of $G$ is the minimum width of any branch-decomposition of $G$.
