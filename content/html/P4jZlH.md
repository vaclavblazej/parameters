## [degeneracy](../m2q96O) â†’ [chromatic number](../MB1Sr1)
* Greedily color the vertices in order of the degeneracy ordering. As each vertex has at most $k$ colored predecesors we use at most $k+1$ colors.
* This inclusion is proper because [bipartite](#cLHJkW) graph class has bounded [chromatic number](../MB1Sr1) but unbounded [degeneracy](../m2q96O)
