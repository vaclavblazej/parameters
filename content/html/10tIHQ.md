## [vertex integrity](../KVhJFB) â†’ [treedepth](../KEP2qM)
* First, treedepth removes vertices of the modulator, then it iterates through remaining components one by one.
* This inclusion is proper because [stars](#10JR3F) graph class has bounded [treedepth](../KEP2qM) but unbounded [vertex integrity](../KVhJFB)
