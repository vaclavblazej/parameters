## [feedback edge set](../HTk9PZ) â†’ [genus](../gbaHdw)
* Removing $k$ edges creates a forest that is embeddable into the plane. We now add one handle for each of the $k$ edges to get embedding into $k$-handle genus.
* This inclusion is proper because [grid](#lfYXuK) graph class has bounded [genus](../gbaHdw) but unbounded [feedback edge set](../HTk9PZ)
