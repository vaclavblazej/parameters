* [carving-width]({{< base >}}html/dS6OgO) -- A carving can be described as an unrooted binary tree whose leaves are labeled with the vertices of the given graph. Removing any edge from this tree partitions the tree into two subtrees, and correspondingly partitions the vertices of the tree into two clusters. ... The width of a carving, defined in this way, is the maximum number of edges that connect two complementary clusters. The carving width of the graph is the minimum width of any hierarchical clustering.
