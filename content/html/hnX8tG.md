# edge removal

The complexity of a graph may be described by the number of edges that we need to remove to get a simple graph class. This often means removing edges to that a forbidden structure is not contained in the graph, e.g., a cycle ([feedback edge set]({{< base >}}html/HTk9PZ)) or an odd cycle ([odd cycle transversal]({{< base >}}html/Ve5ruW)). Hitting each structure X is also called X-transversal.
