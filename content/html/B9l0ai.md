## [distance to disjoint cycles](../AGnF5Z_dist) â†’ [treewidth](../IcKqSn)
* After removal of $k$ vertices the remaining class has a bounded width $w$. So by including the removed vertices in every bag, we can achieve decomposition of width $w+k$
* This inclusion is proper because [constant components](#FJ8gmU) graph class has bounded [treewidth](../IcKqSn) but unbounded [distance to disjoint cycles](../AGnF5Z_dist)
