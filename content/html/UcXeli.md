## [domination number](../Gq0onN) â†’ [diameter](../QF9fW9)
* An unbounded diameter implies a long path where no vertices that are more than $3$ apart may be dominated by the same dominating vertex, otherwise we could shorten the path. Hence, the number of dominating vertices is also unbounded.
* This inclusion is proper because [stars](#10JR3F) graph class has bounded [diameter](../QF9fW9) but unbounded [domination number](../Gq0onN)
