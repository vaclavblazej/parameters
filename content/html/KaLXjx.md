# branch decomposition

Branch decomposition is an unrooted tree with inner vertices of degree 3. Leaves represent (typically) edges of the graph. Every edge of this tree then implies a partition of the leaves into two sets -- which reflects in partition of the graph. We have some measure of how this partition os good and the decomposition which minimizes the measure over all its edges.
