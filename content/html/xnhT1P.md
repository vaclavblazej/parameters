* [treewidth]({{< base >}}html/5Q7fuR) -- Very roughly, treewidth captures how similar a graph is to a tree. There are many ways to define ``tree-likeness'' of a graph; ... it appears that the approach most useful from algorithmic and graph theoretical perspectives, is to view tree-likeness of a graph $G$ as the existence of a structural decomposition of $G$ into pieces of bounded size that are connected in a tree-like fashion. This intuitive concept is formalized via the notions of a *tree decomposition* and the *treewidth* of a graph; the latter is a quantitative measure of how good a tree decomposition we can possibly obtain.
