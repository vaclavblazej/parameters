## treewidth
* graphclasses.org: [treewidth](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/par_10.html)
* [↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth) ..., the treewidth of an undirected graph is an integer number which specifies, informally, how far the graph is from being a tree.
* [↗](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~malcin/book/parameterized-algorithms.pdf) Very roughly, treewidth captures how similar a graph is to a tree. There are many ways to define ``tree-likeness'' of a graph; ... it appears that the approach most useful from algorithmic and graph theoretical perspectives, is to view tree-likeness of a graph $G$ as the existence of a structural decomposition of $G$ into pieces of bounded size that are connected in a tree-like fashion. This intuitive concept is formalized via the notions of a *tree decomposition* and the *treewidth* of a graph; the latter is a quantitative measure of how good a tree decomposition we can possibly obtain.
