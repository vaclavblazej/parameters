## [distance to isolated vertices](../LsiBbX_dist) â†’ [distance to linear forest](../skQuFN_dist)
* graph inclusion
* This inclusion is proper because [linear forest](#skQuFN) graph class has bounded [distance to linear forest](../skQuFN_dist) but unbounded [distance to isolated vertices](../LsiBbX_dist)
