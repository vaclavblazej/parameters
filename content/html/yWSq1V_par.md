## [distance to isolated vertices](../LsiBbX_dist) â†’ [distance to constant components](../FJ8gmU_dist)
* graph inclusion
* This inclusion is proper because [constant components](#FJ8gmU) graph class has bounded [distance to constant components](../FJ8gmU_dist) but unbounded [distance to isolated vertices](../LsiBbX_dist)
