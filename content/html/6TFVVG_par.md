## [distance to complete](../WAU7vf_connected_dist) â†’ [distance to co-cluster](../7HR4uV_dist)
* graph inclusion
* This inclusion is proper because [co-cluster](#7HR4uV) graph class has bounded [distance to co-cluster](../7HR4uV_dist) but unbounded [distance to complete](../WAU7vf_connected_dist)
