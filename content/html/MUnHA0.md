## twin cover number
* Distance to cluster where all vertices of each clique are siblings.
* [Tran2022](../uXViPE): An edge $\{v,w\}$ is a twin edge if vertices $v$ and $w$ have the same neighborhood excluding each other. The twin cover number $tcn(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the size of a smallest set $V' \subseteq V(G)$ of vertices such that every edge in $E(G)$ is either a twin edge or incident to a vertex in $V'$
