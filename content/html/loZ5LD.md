    * page 89 : [planar]({{< base >}}html/loZ5LD) -- When we draw a graph on a piece of paper, we naturally try to do this as transparently as possible. One obvious way to limit the mess created by all the lines is to avoid intersections. ... Graphs drawn in this way are called \emph{plane graphs}; abstract graphs that can be drawn in this way are called \emph{planar}.
