* page 14 : [book thickness]({{< base >}}html/doijTS) $k$ upper bounds [acyclic chromatic number]({{< base >}}html/QGZuUW) by $2^{\mathcal O(k)}$ -- Theorem 5. Acyclic chromatic number is bounded by stack-number (ed: a.k.a. book-thickness). In particular, every $k$-stack graph $G$ has acyclich chromatic number $\chi_a(G) \le 80^{k(2k-1)}$.
