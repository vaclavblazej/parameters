## [bandwidth](../aP5a38) â†’ [pathwidth](../nQhAoF)
* Having bandwidth $k$, order vertices by their values. We create a bag for each vertex $u$ by taking $u$ and all vertices that have a value that is at most $k$ larger than the value of $u$. All edges fall into some bag and vertices span connected span of bags.
* This inclusion is proper because [stars](#10JR3F) graph class has bounded [pathwidth](../nQhAoF) but unbounded [bandwidth](../aP5a38)
