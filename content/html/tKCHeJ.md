## [treedepth](../KEP2qM) â†’ [pathwidth](../nQhAoF)
* Saving the set of open vertices in a DFS over the tree treedepth after every step yields bags of a nice path decomposition.
* This inclusion is proper because [linear forest](#skQuFN) graph class has bounded [pathwidth](../nQhAoF) but unbounded [treedepth](../KEP2qM)
