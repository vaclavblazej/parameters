## twin-width
* [â†—](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486655) ... we consider a sequence of graph $G_n,G_{n-1},\dots,G_2,G_1$, where $G_n$ is the original graph $G$, $G_1$ is the one-vertex graph, $G_i$ has $i$ vertices, and $G_{i-1}$ is obtained from $G_i$ by performing a single contraction of two (non-necessarily adjacent) vertices. For every vertex $u \in V(G_i)$, let us denote by $u(G)$ the vertices of $G$ which have been contracted to $u$ along the sequence $G_n,\dots,G_i$. A pair of disjoint sets of vertices is homogeneous if, between these sets, there are either all possible edges or no edge at all. The red edges mentioned previously consist of all pairs $uv$ of vertices of $G_i$ such that $u(G)$ and $v(G)$ are not homogeneous in $G$. If the red degree of every $G_i$ is at most $d$, then $G_n,G_{n-1},\dots,G_2,G_1$ is called a sequence of $d$-contractions, or $d$-sequence. The twin-width of $G$ is the minimum $d$ for which there exists a sequence of $d$-contractions.
