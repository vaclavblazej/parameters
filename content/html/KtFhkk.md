## [distance to linear forest](../skQuFN_dist) â†’ [pathwidth](../nQhAoF)
* After removal of $k$ vertices the remaining class has a bounded width $w$. So by including the removed vertices in every bag, we can achieve decomposition of width $w+k$
* This inclusion is proper because [stars](#10JR3F) graph class has bounded [pathwidth](../nQhAoF) but unbounded [distance to linear forest](../skQuFN_dist)
