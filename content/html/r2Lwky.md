* page 3 : [complete]({{< base >}}html/EhdXNA) -- If all the vertices of $G$ are pairwise adjacent, then $G$ is \emph{complete}.
* page 5 : [edgeless]({{< base >}}html/LsiBbX) -- A vertex of degree $0$ is \emph{isolated}.
* page 13 : [forest]({{< base >}}html/JngPPm) -- An acyclic graph, one not containing any cycles, is called a \emph{forest}.
* page 17 : [bipartite]({{< base >}}html/cLHJkW) -- Instead of `2-partite' one usually says bipartite.
* page 89 : [planar]({{< base >}}html/loZ5LD) -- When we draw a graph on a piece of paper, we naturally try to do this as transparently as possible. One obvious way to limit the mess created by all the lines is to avoid intersections. ... Graphs drawn in this way are called \emph{plane graphs}; abstract graphs that can be drawn in this way are called \emph{planar}.
* page 115 : [outerplanar]({{< base >}}html/0oCyaG) -- A graph is called outerplanar if it has a drawing in which every vertex lies on the boundary of the outer face.
* page 135 : [chordal]({{< base >}}html/Cv1PaJ) -- ... a graph is chordal (or triangulated) if each of its cycles of length at least $4$ has a chord, i.e. if it contains no induced cycles other than triangles.
* page 135 : [perfect]({{< base >}}html/RmssrZ) -- A graph is called perfect if every induced subgraph $H \subseteq G$ has chromatic number $\chi(H)=\omega(H)$, i.e. if the trivial lower bound of $\omega(H)$ colours always suffices to colour the vertices of $H$.
* page 145 : [interval]({{< base >}}html/p5skoj) -- A graph $G$ is called an \emph{interval graph} if there exists a set $\{ I_v \mid v \in V(G) \}$ of real intervals such that $I_u \cap I_v \ne \emptyset$ if and only if $uv \in E(G)$.
