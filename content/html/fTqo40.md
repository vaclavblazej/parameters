## chordality
* [â†—](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jgt.3190170210) The *chordality* of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is defined as the minimum $k$ such that we can write $E=E_1,\cap\dots\cap E_k$ with each $(V,E_i)$ a chordal graph.
* [Tran2022](../uXViPE): The chordality of a graph $G$ is the minimum amount of chordal graphs required, such that their intersecten results in $G$
