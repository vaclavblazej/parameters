    * page 15 : [neighborhood diversity]({{< base >}}html/vMs3RS) -- The neighborhood diversity $nd(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest number $k$ such that there is a $k$-partition $(V_1,\dots,V_k)$ of $G$, where each subset $V_i$, $i \in [k]$ is a module and is either a complete set or an independent set.
    * page 23 : [edge clique cover number]({{< base >}}html/nYQDv6) $k$ upper bounds [neighborhood diversity]({{< base >}}html/vMs3RS) by $\mathcal O(k)$ -- Theorem 4.1. Edge Clique Cover Number strictly upper bounds Neighborhood Diversity.
    * page 23 : bounded [neighborhood diversity]({{< base >}}html/vMs3RS) does not imply bounded [edge clique cover number]({{< base >}}html/nYQDv6) -- Theorem 4.1. Edge Clique Cover Number strictly upper bounds Neighborhood Diversity.

    * [neighborhood diversity]({{< base >}}html/vMs3RS) upper bounds [shrub-depth]({{< base >}}html/NTgNzT) by a constant -- $\mathcal{TM}_m(1)$ is exactly the class of graphs of neighborhood diversity at most $m$.

    * [neighborhood diversity]({{< base >}}html/vMs3RS) -- We will say that two vertices $v, v'$ of a graph $G(V, E)$ have the same *type* iff they have the same colors and $N(v) \setminus \{v\}=N(v') \setminus \{v\}$, where $N(v)$ denotes the set of neighbors of $v$. ... A colored graph $G(V, E)$ has neighborhood diversity at most $w$, if there exists a partition of $V$ into at most $w$ sets, such that all the vertices in each set have the same type.
