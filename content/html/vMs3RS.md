    * [neighborhood diversity]({{< base >}}html/vMs3RS) -- We will say that two vertices $v, v'$ of a graph $G(V, E)$ have the same *type* iff they have the same colors and $N(v) \setminus \{v\}=N(v') \setminus \{v\}$, where $N(v)$ denotes the set of neighbors of $v$. ... A colored graph $G(V, E)$ has neighborhood diversity at most $w$, if there exists a partition of $V$ into at most $w$ sets, such that all the vertices in each set have the same type.
