## neighborhood diversity
* [â†—](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00453-011-9554-x) We will say that two vertices $v, v'$ of a graph $G(V, E)$ have the same *type* iff they have the same colors and $N(v) \setminus \{v\}=N(v') \setminus \{v\}$, where $N(v)$ denotes the set of neighbors of $v$. ... A colored graph $G(V, E)$ has neighborhood diversity at most $w$, if there exists a partition of $V$ into at most $w$ sets, such that all the vertices in each set have the same type.
* [Tran2022](../uXViPE): The neighborhood diversity $nd(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest number $k$ such that there is a $k$-partition $(V_1,\dots,V_k)$ of $G$, where each subset $V_i$, $i \in [k]$ is a module and is either a complete set or an independent set.
