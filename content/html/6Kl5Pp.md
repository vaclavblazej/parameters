## [treedepth](../KEP2qM) â†’ [diameter](../QF9fW9)
* An unbounded diameter implies the class contains paths as subgraphs. Minimum treedepth to embed a path of length $n$ in a treedepth tree is $\log n$.
* [SchroderThesis](../DYGiYb): Proposition 3.1
* This inclusion is proper because [cograph](#9Qd0Mx) graph class has bounded [diameter](../QF9fW9) but unbounded [treedepth](../KEP2qM)
