## acyclic chromatic number
* graphclasses.org: [acyclic chromatic number](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/par_31.html)
* [↗](https://www.graphclasses.org/classes/par_31.html) The acyclic chromatic number of a graph $G$ is the smallest size of a vertex partition $V_1,\dots,V_\ell$ such that each $V_i$ is an independent set and for all $i,j$ that graph $G[V_i \cup V_j]$ does not contain a cycle.
* [↗](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acyclic_coloring) ... an acyclic coloring is a (proper) vertex coloring in which every 2-chromatic subgraph is acyclic.
