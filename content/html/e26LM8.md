# vertex removal

Some vertices of the graph may completely describe the complex structure of the graph, and the remainder may fall into a simple graph class. This includes variants of removing the vertices such as removing a set of vertices all at once (vertex cover), or removing vertices one by one (treedepth), resulting in a simple or a complex graph class (e.g. distance to X and elimination distance to X).
