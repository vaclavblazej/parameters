## [distance to stars](../10JR3F_dist) â†’ [treedepth](../KEP2qM)
* First, treedepth removes vertices of the modulator, remainder has treedepth $2$
* This inclusion is proper because [constant components](#FJ8gmU) graph class has bounded [treedepth](../KEP2qM) but unbounded [distance to stars](../10JR3F_dist)
