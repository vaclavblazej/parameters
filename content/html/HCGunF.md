* [treewidth]({{< base >}}html/5Q7fuR) equal to $k$ implies that [clique width]({{< base >}}html/wg5HuV) is upper bounded by $2^{\mathcal O(k)}$ -- ... the clique-width of $G$ is at most $3 \cdot 2k - 1$ and, more importantly, that there is an exponential lower bound on this relationship. In particular, for any $k$, there is a graph $G$ with treewidth equal to $k$, where the clique-width of $G$ is at least $2\lfloor k/2\rfloor-1$.
