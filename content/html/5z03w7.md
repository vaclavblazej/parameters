## [boolean-width](../XPNgY0) → [twin-width](../VipBQc)
* [↗](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3486655) Theorem 3: Every graph with boolean-width $k$ has twin-width at most $2^{k+1}-1$.
* This inclusion is proper because [planar](#loZ5LD) graph class has bounded [twin-width](../VipBQc) but unbounded [boolean-width](../XPNgY0)
