## [distance to isolated vertices](../LsiBbX_dist) â†’ [distance to co-cluster](../7HR4uV_dist)
* graph inclusion
* This inclusion is proper because [complete](#WAU7vf_connected) graph class has bounded [distance to co-cluster](../7HR4uV_dist) but unbounded [distance to isolated vertices](../LsiBbX_dist)
