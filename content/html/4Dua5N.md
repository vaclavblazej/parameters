* page 7 : [shrub-depth]({{< base >}}html/NTgNzT) -- Tree-model of $m$ colors and depth $d$: a rooted tree $T$ of height $d$, leaves are the vertices of $G$, each leaf has one of $m$ colors, an associated signature determining the edge set of $G$ as follows: for $i=1,2,\dots,d$, let $u$ and $v$ be leaves with the least common ancestor at height $i$ in $T$, then $uv \in E(G)$ iff the color pair of $u,v$ is in the signature at height $i$.
* page 9 : [neighborhood diversity]({{< base >}}html/vMs3RS) upper bounds [shrub-depth]({{< base >}}html/NTgNzT) by a constant -- Shrub-depth 1: e.g., cliques, stars, \dots, gen. BND -- bounded neighborhood diversity.
