## [vertex cover](../4lp9Yj) → [neighborhood diversity](../vMs3RS)
* [↗](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00453-011-9554-x) Construct $k$ singleton sets, one for each vertex in the vertex cover and at most $2^k$ additional sets, one for each subset of vertices of the vertex cover. ...
* This inclusion is proper because [complete](#WAU7vf_connected) graph class has bounded [neighborhood diversity](../vMs3RS) but unbounded [vertex cover](../4lp9Yj)
